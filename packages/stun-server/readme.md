# STUN Server in BUN

What is a STUN server?

STUN - Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address Translators (NATs) [[Read RFC]("https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt")]

Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network
Address Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that
allows applications to discover the presence and types of NATs and
firewalls between them and the public Internet. It also provides the
ability for applications to determine the public Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses allocated to them by the NAT. STUN works with many
existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.
As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through
existing NAT infrastructure.
